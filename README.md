## Calculatron

It's a simple single-page web application that contains a functioning calculator. Push the buttons, see the output or an error message if something's wrong.

### Key elements

  * Ruby 2.3.3
  * Rails 4.2
  * `math_engine` for parsing and computations
  * Bootstrap (for UI, better than nothing)

### `TODO`s:

  * Fork or clone this project to your machine.
  * Write out functional tests for the calculator app. Do not worry about browser/device tests.
  * Complete the functional tests.
  * Document any bugs you find with screenshots and/or screencasts with descriptions of the bugs.
  * Open a Github issue for each bug found, include descriptions and screenshots.
  * Push to a personal repo.
